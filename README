Viri :: Remote execution of Python scripts
==========================================

Website: http://viriproject.com
Development site: https://github.com/garcia-marc/

Project description
-------------------
The aim of the Viri project is to provide an efficient and organized way to
run Python scripts in remote hosts. This is specially useful to perform system
administration tasks in data centers.

Imagine you are the administrator of 1000 hosts (physical or virtual). With
Viri, you can automate tasks to all those hosts almost like if you had to
perform them in one. Some examples of tasks you would like to run include:
 * Change configuration files.
 * Run backups.
 * Gather host information to a central location.
 * Control user access to the host.
 * Install software.
 * And everything you are able to code in Python.

While providing a set of scripts, the idea behind Viri is to let system
administrators to write their own scripts. Viri is just a framework for
remotely executing any Python script.

Viri's core is the virid daemon, which needs to be installed in every host of
the infrastructure. Then, the command line utility, or a custom application
can be used to manage scripts and data.
