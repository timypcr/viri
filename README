viri is a distributed system for easy deployment and execution of Python
scripts.

To build a viri infrastructure, you need to install the viri daemon
(virid) in every host, including your workstation, and in the later
you also need to install the viri command line utility (viric). From
viric, you can send instructions to some or all hosts in your
infrastructure, to run some Python script that you just have in your
local host.
